The OneSyria Project

Overview
The project aims to create a Decentralized Autonomous Government as an alternative digital government in Syria, that is autonomous, inclusive, transparent, and democratic. The DAG will be built using Blockchain technology and will allow citizens to vote on laws, policies, and budget allocation directly and securely. The objectives of the project are to create a parallel system that is fair, secure, and promotes equality for all citizens, and ultimately, gain local and international recognition over the current government. 



# OneSyria

## Overview
This project aims to create a *Decentralized Autonomous Government* as an alternative, digital government to the current Syrian Gov. That is autonomous, inclusive, transparent, and democratic. The DAG will be built using Blockchain technology and will allow citizens to vote on laws, policies, and budget allocation directly and securely. The main goal of this project is to create a new system that is fair, secure, and promotes equality for all citizens, and ultimately, gain local and international recognition over the current government.

## Why Syria 
The Syrian Civil War has been ongoing for over eight years, with no end in sight. The conflict has caused more than 600,000 deaths, displaced more than 13 million people, and destroyed vast swaths of the country. The war has become increasingly complex, with a multitude of actors and interests involved. There have been numerous attempts to fix the situation, but none have been successful.

However, this is not limited to Syria… We hope that this will inspire other nations too to overcome the corruption.

## But, how?
A. Blockchain
B. Using Open-Source!

To create a new system that's trusted by nations and the whole world, *we're inviting the whole world to contribute to this system* and help make it real for millions of people. Blockchain can enable such system.


## Is this for real? 
let’s actually make it real! 

But here are the initial parameters: 
- DAO: *Decentralized Autonomous Organization* is a working -proven- concept, so we just need to pivot it to a _government_ with each citizen have an equal stake.
- Mobile-first blockchain: Although, not quite perfect, but a large majority people in Syria own a smartphone with a camera and access to internet -even if partially-, which makes a mobile app a very good main client candidate.
- Worldwide support: The whole world will be able to help Syria DAG with their computation power and other means, since transparency ensured by design.
- Funding: Thinking about providing 'shares' in the new government which can entitle their holders to some features/perks in the country or an RoI; This could be a good way to help fund the _country_ DAG.


So, it’s not completely crazy. It’s doable. We need everyone to help. 

## Ok. Amazing. How do I help?
Thank you <3 for your interest... millions of people in-need around the globe will have a better future because of your contributions. just imagine that.

#### There are 4 areas you can contribute in:


### Technical
If you have experience in software architecture, development, or testing, you're welcome to contribute by choosing the repository that fits your skills:
> TODO: Provide list of repos 

### Legal and Policy
To make sure the DAG is aligned with the international laws, and compatible with its current state, we need legal expertise to help in assessing each case the contributors might encounter.
You can provide your legal opinion on any of the opened cases here: 
> TODO: Provide the legal board 

### User Experience 
Because this project will potentially reach millions, of different backgrounds and education levels, the user experience must be created with care. If you feel creative, check out our experience Board: 
> TODO: Provide the ux board


## Who is be behind this government and what are your goals?
This is a collaborative, human project that’s not driven or managed or oriented by any entity.

The main goal is to end human suffering.
Millions are suffering around the globe, in Syria and in other countries, and its because of corrupt systems.

Empowering people with a transparent, inclusive system would allow them to overcome corruption and end their suffering.
